								<p>This microservice implements an TFIDF based feature extraction system coupled with a libsvm based classifier. It is a trainer as well as an athlete
								 producing controlled vocabularies and term documenty frequencies as part of its model. Only terms that have high tfidf values for each category are added 
								 to the controlled vocabulary.  Based on this vocabulary, support vectors are computed and also 
								 stored within the model.</p>

										<h2>Classifier-Trainer</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A classifier assigns documents to categories based on their content by employing machine learning. 
									This service is part of the Classifier Trainer/Athlete pattern developed by Tobias Eljasik-Swoboda. 
									A Trainer Service uses machine learning to learn from existing document-to-category assignments. After having learned from these examples,
									an Athlete Service can use these insights to perform classifications. This facilitates Scale-Out.
									A Trainer Service always includes an Athlete Service. Each C3 Service is available as JAR file and Docker Container. This makes them runable anywhere.
									<br/> The service employs multiple endpoints using a REST/JSON API. This is wrapped in the classifier-trainer.js JavaScript employed by this web GUI. 
									<br/> Serving this web GUI can be turned off in the configuration yml prior to starting the service.
